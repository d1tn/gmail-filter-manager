- Added a folder management feature. Please make use of this when you have a large number of filters.
    - Folders can be created simply by clicking the folder icon in the left menu.
    - You can move filters into folders by dragging and dropping them.
    - Folders do not affect the Gmail filter structure; they are used solely for organization within this extension.
    - Please note that a paid subscription is required to create 11 or more folders. We appreciate your understanding to help maintain the development.
    - Rest assured, you can still create an unlimited number of filters for free.
- Added a version update notification feature.
    - Update details will now automatically display upon launching the extension after an update.
    - Clicking the close button will hide the notification until the next version.
    - You can manually view this update history by clicking the version number in the header.
